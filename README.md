# Clusterfuc

Don't need bells and whistles, and just want to slam absolute ungodly amounts of snail pace text against an LLM?
Clusterfuc is an attempt to achieve that.

## Premise

This is more of a toy library/repository for playing with AI agents at a more base-level without as many abstractions.
It is focused on ease of use, allowing for auto-tool calling based on functions supplied to an agent.

## MCP?

Yeah MCP is generally going to be superior in a lot of scenarios, but currently doesn't have good/any remote
support and this clusterfuc of a toy library is meant to operate in some tiny server somewhere.

## Agent Flows

An agent itself is just another tool.

## Providers

- Gemini (Not Vertex AI)
- OpenAI
